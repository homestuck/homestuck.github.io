Originally developed by <em>Bambosh</em> and <em>Giovan_h</em>, The <em>Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> is a fan-created browser for reading <em>Homestuck</em> and other works by <em>Andrew Hussie</em> as they were originally intended to be experienced with native Flash support. The browser does not fetch content from the internet and instead utilizes an Asset Pack that must be downloaded by the user alongside the software for it to serve content. The UHC includes a <em>"New Reader Mode"</em> to present <em>Homestuck</em> as it was originally released, an inline media player for streaming music from the <em>Homestuck Bandcamp</em>, and many more features to enhance the user's reading experience. 

A new "Official" Homestuck Collection is now in development, and the original <em>Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> will continue to be preserved and available here. It should be noted that while it remains open source, any official updates or changes will be made on a new Homestuck Independent Creative Union controlled GitHub fork that can be found <a href="https://github.com/homestuck-independent-creative-union/unofficial-homestuck-collection">here</a>.

<strong>Download</strong>
To use the <em>Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> you must download the <em>UHC App (80mb)</em> and <em>Asset Pack V2 (4.3gb)</em>. You can download these separately, or bundled together below. Updating the application does not require you to redownload the Asset Pack.
